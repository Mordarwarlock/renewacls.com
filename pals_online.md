title: PALS Courses & Classes

EMT Concepts offers online Pediatric Advanced Life Support certification and recertification courses that can be done from the comfort and convenience in your home, on your computer. This flexibility allows healthcare professionals and practitioners to obtain their PALS provider card without having to attend a local class or having to do a hands-on skills test.

Our courses were created for those medical professionals who would be otherwise unable to take the course due to the time constraints of their busy schedules. There are no time limits once you sign up for the course which provides the opportunity to truly take it at your own pace.

Once you purchase the PALS course, you will receive immediate access to a plethora of information and study material around the course so you can fully prepare for the exam. Once ready to take the exam, while there is no time limit, it does need to be successfully completed in one session for certification or recertification.

We want you to succeed and include 3 free retakes on all our PALS classes. Should you not pass on the first attempt, our system provides feedback on incorrect answers so you can zero in on areas to review.

**Note:** We are continuing to work through our PALS online course offering to bring a truly innovative learning experience for those in need of this certification or recertification. In the meantime, we can recommend these online providers.
