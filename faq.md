### 1. Can I take the exam online?

Answer: Yes. Regardless of your employer's requirements, you will be able to take at least the written test online.

### 2. Do I need to take a skills test?

Answer: It depends on if you need your initial certification or you will be recertifying, plus whether your employer requires AHA accreditation. All AHA courses require skills testing. However, non-AHA recertification courses do not.
