This site is a free resource about ACLS and specifically the Advanced Cardiac Life Support renewal process. We're starting out with just the basics of how things work, and we'll be expanding the site over time with a lot of more detailed information (as we have time). This is a topic we are passionate about and there is not a lot of information about it on the Internet, so our goal with the site is to build a great resource that meets the need for current, accurate information in a format that is easy to understand and use.
