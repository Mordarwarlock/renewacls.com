While purchasing food for lunch, two firefighters rushed into the aid of a man who collapsed in one of the aisles at the West Ottawa supermarket. Despite being off- duty, they got a kick of adrenaline when buyers called for help to revive the 60- year old man who went into cardiac arrest. Seeing no vital signs, they performed CPR while other firefighters outside brought in equipment, such as a defibrillator. The off- duty firefighters continued the compressions, followed by three shocks, until the man was revived. The victim is expected to make a full recovery at the hospital, but thanks to the firefighters, he got a good fighting chance.
