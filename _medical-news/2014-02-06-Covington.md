Bri Webb was invited to a Super Bowl Party by a family friend, and the last thing she expected was to save a life. The Fontenot family was incredibly thankful that Webb had been re- certified in CPR a week before the accident, since it secured the survival of one of their children. 3- year- old Sydney was choking on a meatball when Bri found her on top of the stairs. She immediately performed the Heimlich, but Sydney slumped unconscious after the offending meatball got out of her system. Bri knew she needed to get oxygen in her brain; thus, performing CPR. The paramedics arrived shortly after and drove Sydney into a childrenâ€™s hospital where she is expected to make a full recovery.
