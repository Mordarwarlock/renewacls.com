Officer Austin White was doing his job near the Grand Glaize Bridge when he was hit by a pickup truck. He went unconscious immediately and was critically injured. Aside from White, the pickup truck had also done damage to a police car and a Ford Ranger, both with passengers. A motorist saw the incident and rushed to White to evaluate his condition. Upon checking for a pulse, he found none. The motorist applied chest compressions immediately to revive the heart, while bystanders called 911 to respond to the accident. The police officer was carried to the hospital by an air ambulance and made a full recovery. He is yet to thank his savior for a job well done in keeping him alive.
