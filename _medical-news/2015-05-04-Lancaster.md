JJ Pesany was just playing on the athletic field of the Lancaster High School when he received an electric shock from a portable goal post. Luckily, detective Keith Kerl heard the emergency call and rushed to the scene. He administered CPR to the boy who went into cardiac arrest. He also had a defibrillator with him, which he used on Pesany before the boy was transported to the local hospital. The family is grateful to Kerl, but the detective wanted something from them. He wished that they would get CPR training and be certified by the local fire hall. True to their promise, JJ, his family and 20 of his teammates from the school got their CPR AED Course Completion cards in a matter of weeks after the incident.
