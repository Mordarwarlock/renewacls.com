You take a CPR class and hope for the best that you won’t ever need it. After working in child care for 22 years, a Hamilton Township preschool owner had never been in a situation where she had to perform CPR on one of the children under her care – until a 1-year old toddler had a seizure and turned blue. The staff brought the limp child to the owner’s office and they called 911. After confirming to the operator that she knew CPR, the owner began administering CPR to the child. Relief flooded in the room when the child’s chest began moving when she was able to breathe. An ambulance arrived and the child was brought to a hospital.
