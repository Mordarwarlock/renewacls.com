Trevor Ballif thought he was just experiencing a normal workday when he witnessed a motorcycle crash on his way towards the hospital. The cyclist was unconscious and lying in the middle of the road, turning blue. Ballif leapt into action and conducted CPR for about 5 minutes. Before the EMS arrived, he experienced a miracle. The respiratory therapist observed the cyclist turn from blue to pink, until his conditions were stable. The ambulance rushed the victim to the hospital where proper care was administered. The survival of the cyclist was due to the efforts of Trevor Ballif and his knowledge of CPR.
