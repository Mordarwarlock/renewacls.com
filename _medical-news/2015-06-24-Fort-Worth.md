A boy was visiting YMCA Camp Carter for a day camp. He was having a great time swimming in the pool when suddenly he became distressed and was unable to go to the surface. He was sinking to the bottom of the pool. The pool’s lifeguards saw the situation and one of them immediately dove to the boy’s aid. He was raised to the surface, and was placed in a safe area. The lifeguards of the establishments were able to revive him using CPR. He was able to walk to the ambulance that would take him to the nearest hospital for further care.
