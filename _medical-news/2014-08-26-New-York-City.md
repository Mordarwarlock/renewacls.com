A former Army Ranger was literally at the right place at the right time when he heard on his radio about an emergency. He happened to be just outside the family’s home, checking for speeding motorists. He wasted no time in responding to the emergency and found the parents and their baby who had stopped breathing and was turning blue. After assessing the situation, he quickly administered light chest compressions on the infant as the desperate parents looked on. Shortly after, the baby was responsive and was already breathing on her own when EMS workers arrived. The parents are now hailing the officer as their hero.
