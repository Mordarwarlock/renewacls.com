It was a day like any other for an old Bourne man. He went to shop at a market where he’s well-known and as he was shopping, he suddenly collapsed on the floor. The assistant meat department manager heard the commotion and someone shouted that the victim was not breathing. This was the first time he had used his CPR training as he performed chest compressions on the victim. When the patrolman arrived, he took over the compressions while the assistant administered oxygen. Paramedics arrived soon after and brought the victim to a hospital where he was able to recover fully and celebrate the holiday with his family.
