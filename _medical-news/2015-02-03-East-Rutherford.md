A Nets scout suffered a heart attack which led to cardiac arrest before the team’s practice in New Jersey. It was fortunate that he was present at the practice instead of being somewhere else, which is more typical in a scout’s life. If he suffered the heart attack somewhere else, he wouldn’t have been saved by the team’s athletic trainer. Together with the team’s assistant trainers and massage therapist, they performed CPR on the man and, with the use of a defibrillator, bought the scout back. East Rutherford police officers also had their fair share of help in the situation.
