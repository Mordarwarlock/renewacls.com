For a Colorado Spring police officer, saving someoneâ€™s life is a rewarding part of his job. But to do it three times is a feat. The third life he saved was of a 13-day old infant who was unconscious and stopped breathing one morning. The police officers were the first ones to arrive at the scene before the fire department and they began performing CPR. The officer was doing CPR for about a minute before paramedics arrived. One minute that may seem quick to some people but for the officer, felt like an eternity. The infant was revived and was immediately brought to a hospital.
