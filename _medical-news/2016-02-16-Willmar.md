Nick Stien was at his home in a Willmar apartment with his family when he heard some heavy knocks on the door. It was a neighbor searching for someone who could help a man who had collapsed on the hallway floor. That is when the young hero jumped to action "I just thought that if I didn’t do anything, he could probably die.” said Stein. He began performing CPR while his family called the EMT services. The man was transported to a medical center where he managed to recover.
