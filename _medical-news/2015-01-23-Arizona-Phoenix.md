Two Orange County firefighters were on a flight to Houston along with their canine partners to attend a training seminar when a man sitting in front of them suddenly stood up and called for help. One of the firefighters caught the man as he collapses and goes into cardiac arrest. They immediately started CPR, hooked the man up to an IV and used a defibrillator.  The flight was diverted to Phoenix but the man was already conscious and talking by the time Phoenix paramedics reached the plane. The plane continued its flight to Texas after some delay but the patient was brought to a hospital.
