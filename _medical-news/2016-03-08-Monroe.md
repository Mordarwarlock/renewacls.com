Taylor Anaka, 12, and his father Brian were moving furniture from their home onto a Uhaul truck when Brian collapsed.  Taylor handled the situation very maturly for his age and called 911.  Then he began performing CPR, although he has never had a class.  Once emergency responders arrived, they took over and were able to revive Brian. The medical staff believe that Taylor's actions saved his father's life.  Brian is now recovering at home.
