Amanda Carlile, a mother of four beautiful children, was just inside the house, cleaning when her three year old daughter said she wanted to go outside with her grandmother. Amanda consented. After a while, when she went out, she saw her daughter in the swimming pool, without her trusty floaters. Amanda quickly fished her daughter out of the pool and performed CPR. Apparently, the toddler accidentally slipped into the pool. They were able to call the emergency management services on time. She kept on performing CPR while they waited for the emergency team. Her daughter was revived and was now recovering.
