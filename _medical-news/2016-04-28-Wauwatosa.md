Anne and Richard Kulikowski were enjoying their patio one afternoon when Richard suddenly slumped over.  Anne knew something was very wrong and called 911.  She couldn't get him out of his chair, so she began chest compressions as best she could.  When paramedics arrived, he still had no heartbeat and used an AED machine right away.  He responded and was then taken to the hospital.  He has since recovered thanks to the quick actions of his wife and the first repsonders.
