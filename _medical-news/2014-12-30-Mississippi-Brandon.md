A 4-year old was saved by neighbors after the car she and her mom were in crashed into the water. A neighbor heard the motherâ€™s scream and when she saw what happened, she jumped into the water without thinking. After 10 minutes of trying to get the girl out, she and other bystanders were able to cut her out of her seat. They placed the girl on the blank and the neighbor did CPR. Chest compressions were administered by a first responder and after about five minutes, the victim was able to breathe on her own. It was a miracle that people with kind hearts were present at the time of the accident.
