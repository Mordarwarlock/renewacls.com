A ten year old boy was camping with his family one day. He was enjoying some time swimming in the pool when he suddenly sank to the bottom, unable to breathe or even pull himself up. His father noticed this and then quickly swam toward him to get him out of the water. Upon reaching land, the boyâ€™s aunt immediately performed chest compressions. They called the emergency management services. As they waited for the rescue team to arrive, the aunt kept performing CPR on him. The boy was revived and was taken to the nearest hospital for advanced care and evaluation.
