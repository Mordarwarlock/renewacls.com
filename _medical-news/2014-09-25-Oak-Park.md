Eric Bell was in good shape, since he does swimming and checks his cholesterol regularly; however, a heart blockage prompted him to collapse and go unconscious after dinner. His wife, Brigette, recalled a CPR discussion she participated days ago, so she asked their child, Harry, to do a “Hands-Only” CPR involving chest compressions. She proceeded to call 911, and replaced Harry when the 17 year old boy was already tired. The 911 dispatcher assisted in counting out the compressions until help arrived. Even if the mother and son thought they were losing him, it was their CPR efforts that secured his life. Now, they are pursuing a healthier lifestyle.
