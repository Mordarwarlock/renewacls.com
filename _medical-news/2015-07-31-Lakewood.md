A mother in Colorado has just finished breastfeeding her 3-month-old son when suddenly the baby started choking and turning blue. The baby boy eventually stopped breathing and was turning into darker shades of blue really fast. The mother frantically called 911. A dispatcher was able to calmly orient her with CPR. By a matter of moments, she was able to lay the baby boy down and perform CPR on him while being instructed by the dispatcher via phone. The chest compressions lasted for three minutes, but the baby was able to breathe again on his own. The mother is thankful for the help she had received.
