A man, suspected of public intoxication, was arrested and booked into detention center in Corpus Christi. To everyone’s surprise, he was found hanging in a cell by the detention center manager. The victim choked himself with his socks and was discovered unconscious. The detention center manager performed CPR on the victim and he was able to revive the inmate. He started breathing again and medics were called. The victim was then brought to a hospital. Fortunately, all the staff at the City Detention Center was required to be trained in CPR. If not, they wouldn’t be able to respond and revive the man at that moment.
