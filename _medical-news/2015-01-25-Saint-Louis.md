A 6-year old girl was unconscious when she was pulled from the bottom of a pool at the Capitol Plaza Hotel in St. Louis, Mo. A registered nurse and a police officer were quick to use their CPR skills and were able to revive the child. It took them five minutes of administering CPR to the little girl before she regained a heartbeat and a pulse. The lifesavers, along with the man who jumped into the pool to pull the child out, were in the city with their own children for a youth ice hockey tournament. It was fortunate that they were all in the vicinity when the accident happened.
