A Palmer resident suddenly collapsed inside the fitness center after going into cardiac arrest. Employees of the center, both women, were in another room when the incident happened and, along with another female companion, they immediately provided aid when they saw the victim on the floor. The victim was a shade of purple and had no pulse when they approached her. They immediately administered chest compressions and used an automated external defibrillator. The reviving took place in 15 minutes but it did sure feel longer for the women. The victim is now doing much better and now has a defibrillator in her heart.
