A 48-year old man was lucky to be playing in a basketball game where an off-duty state trooper and a high school football coach were present. The man became unconscious after he collapsed on the floor, not breathing. The state trooper performed CPR right away and the high school football coach ran to get the automated external defibrillator. Together, they were able to revive the man by using the AED and administering CPR. The victim, already conscious and talking by the time Camden Ambulance arrived, had no recollection of what happened. He was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Utica.
