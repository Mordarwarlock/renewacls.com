A house was burning with two children, a 7-year old and a 2-year old, and an 18-year old baby sitter. The baby sitter along with the 7-year old child managed to get out of the house and asked neighbors to call 911. Two Michigan State Police troopers got to the house and broke a door and a window to get to the young boy whom they found unresponsive. They brought him out and immediately began CPR and luckily, they were able to restore the boyâ€™s breathing. The two children were brought to a hospital and if not for the bravery of the two state troopers, only one child could have survived the fire.
