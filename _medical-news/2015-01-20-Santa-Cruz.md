A vacation did not go well for a tourist after he was found floating in Seabright State beach in the afternoon, facedown. A good Samaritan spotted the tourist and pulled him from the ocean. Santa Cruz firefighters were called to the scene of the accident and paramedics used their CPR skills to revive the man who didn’t have a pulse when he was found. Lifeguards at the beach believed that the man was somehow knocked down by the strong waves, got injured and was left unconscious. The man, around 50s, was later airlifted and transferred to Natividad Medical Center’s trauma center.
