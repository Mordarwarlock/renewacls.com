A former NFL player suddenly fell to the ground, unconscious and not breathing. He was going back home to his newborn child after spending time with his friends. His daytime activity was all he remembered. He didn’t remember losing consciousness, nor feeling the weight of a bystander’s arms upon his chest as he performed CPR on him. The man was desperate to help this stranger, and he was thankful to have contributed to the man’s recovery even after the medics took over. The unconscious man was breathing again by the time he was brought to the hospital for intensive care.
