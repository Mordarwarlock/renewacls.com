After his daily run, Joe Baker thought he would feel energized for the day, but he turned out to be wrong when he went into cardiac arrest.  Students Ryan Fowles and Jake Probert saw him collapse and immediately rushed to his aid. With their CPR training, they performed chest compressions until they secured a pulse. They dialed 911 and waited for the paramedics to transport Baker to the local hospital. Luckily, an EMT was nearby and turned on his pager at the right time. He was able to get to the scene and helped in reviving Baker to life. The three heroic citizens were applauded for their brave deeds.
