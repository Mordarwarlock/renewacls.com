Under two minutes after halftime of a basketball game, a 14-year old boy went into cardiac arrest and collapsed while running on the court. Several bystanders, including a retired firefighter and a nurse, went down to help the teen whose lips turned purple and eyes rolled back. They performed CPR while the teen’s coach went to get the defibrillator. The nurse used the machine and applied it to the teen’s chest. The boy’s heart went back into rhythm after that and soon paramedics arrived to take the boy to a hospital. The 14-year old, who is said to be recovering, has a lot of good Samaritans to thank.
