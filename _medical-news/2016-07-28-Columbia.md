Daniel Hunziker, a Navy recruiter had the chance to save a life, he was walking inside the mall on his way to the office when a worker from the Dillardâ€™s department store called for him asking if he knew CPR. When Hunziker nodded the lady took him inside the store in order to help an unconscious man lying on the floor, he assisted the mall officer who was already present at the scene doing compressions on the civilian, they did so for about 5 minutes until the EMS arrived.
