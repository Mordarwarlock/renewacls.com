An off-duty policeman was about to get food for his break, when he noticed a commotion that had him dead on his tracks. Sgt. Patrick McLaughlin rushed over to inquire whatâ€™s wrong and deduced that the man is having a seizure. Seconds later, breathing had stopped and McLaughlin immediately performed chest compressions. The family of the man is already panicking and dialing the paramedics, while a small crowd gathered. A Pharmacy student also helped in CPR efforts. The man was already breathing even before the ambulance got to him. He was wheeled into the hospital for emergency care, but not before thanking good Samaritans who helped him breathe again.
