An SUV lost control while traveling in icy conditions and crashed upside-down into a stream thatâ€™s 2.5-feet deep in Washington County. The older passengers only suffered minor injuries while a 3-month old infant was trapped inside the submerged car in the water. A man leapt into action and crawled into the SUV to save the infant and used his knife to cut the infant free from her car seat. He was able to pull the girl out from the water and another bystander performed CPR on the 3-month old baby. The baby was revived and was brought to Eastern Maine Medical Center.
