The Montana City School was having its holiday concert when one of the performers had a heart attack during his performance. Fortunately, the concert was attended by several medical professionals. An ambulance owner immediately began CPR and shouted for an automated external defibrillator. Chest compressions were given by several doctors and a nurse while a paramedic defibrillated the victim. After about two minutes, the victim was conscious again. It was only one of the few times that Jefferson County Sheriffâ€™s Deputy has arrived at the scene when the victim of a heart attack was conscious again, thanks to the collective efforts of everyone present.
