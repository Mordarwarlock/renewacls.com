A father encourages CPR training for people after saving the life of his daughter using the same procedure. They were having a family bonding at a pool one day. The father removed his daughter’s life vest to practice swimming in the kiddie pool. After just moments of looking away, he discovered her lying in the bottom of the adult pool. He scooped her out of the water and immediately performed CPR on her. After a while, she was revived and was taken to the hospital for immediate care and further evaluation. The father stresses the importance of CPR in saving anyone’s life.
