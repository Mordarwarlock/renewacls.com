Two Watson’s personnel helped in saving the life of an elderly customer when she collapsed while choosing her purchases in the store. The woman’s granddaughter was with her, looking on as her grandmother lost consciousness and fell to the floor. One employee, after securing the youngster, proceeded to give rescue breathing. The store’s manager immediately helped in performing CPR after calling the emergency hotline. The paramedics arrived shortly and continued reviving the ailing woman. It took a while, including six shocks from the defibrillator, but eventually, the woman was revived. She was very thankful to the people who helped save her life.
