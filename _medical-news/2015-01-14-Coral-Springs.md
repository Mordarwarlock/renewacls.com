A mother of a 1-year old in Broward County had experienced every parent’s worst nightmare – to see their child choking due to obstructed airway. The child choked on a piece of grape and couldn’t make a sound – no sound, cry or even a whisper because her airway was obstructed. After the mother made a call to 911, Coral Springs Fire rescue team arrived at the scene and saw a bystander already administering CPR to the child. Thanks to new innovative pediatric resuscitation system equipment, the team was able to save the child and retrieve the grape that blocked the child’s airway.
