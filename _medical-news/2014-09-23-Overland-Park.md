A middle school student participated in an inter-district cross country meet and what was supposed to be a fun and exciting event, turned into a horrific incident. The 8th-grade student suddenly collapsed during the meet. He went into full cardiac arrest. One of the bystanders was quick to perform CPR even before medics arrived. The 13-year old boy was initially considered code blue â€“ a term used when someone medically died. Fortunately, he was revived at the scene before he was brought to the hospital. This is one of the many situations where someone who had CPR training will come in handy.
