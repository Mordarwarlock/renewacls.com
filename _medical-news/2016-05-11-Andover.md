Sergeant Troy Snedeker was recognized for his role in saving a newborn.  Born prematurely at just 26 weeks gestation, Eden wasn't able to breath.  Snedeker performed infant CPR on the baby before she was admitted to the hospital.  Snedeker says he was just doing his job.  He keeps up with the baby's family through Facebook.
