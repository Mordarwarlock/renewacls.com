Spencer Hamilton had CPR training. His school was able to have this on their health classes, so he was equipped and certified. To his surprise, his skills were put to the test only two months after his training. Spencer works at Asheboro Food Lion, a grocery store. A woman suddenly fell unconscious in the front area of the store he works in. He immediately went to the woman to administer aid. Upon assessing the situation, he applied chest compressions so that the blood would continue to circulate through the womanâ€™s systems. He was relieved by emergency responders afterwards, and they took the woman to the hospital for further care.
