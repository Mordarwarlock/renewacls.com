Nick Stein, a 16 year old junior in high school learned CPR about a year ago.  Stein had just arrived home when a neighbor knocked on his family's aparment door, asking for help as a man, Doug Nelson, had collapsed in the hallway.  Other neighbors started coming out into the hall, but no one knew what to do.  Stein began chest compressions until EMS arrived.  Doctors say this may have helped save the man's brain.  The teenager said he thought if he didn't help, the man would die.  Nelson recovered from the incident, thanks to Steins quick thinking.
