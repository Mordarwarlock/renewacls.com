Lifeguards and siblings Sean and Meg Tuthill helped to save a man's life after he nearly drowned while snorkeling. Sean got the man first and pulled him out of the water. Then, he and his sister began CPR on the man. They kept at it until paramedics arrived at the beach. The man they rescued has made a full recovery.
