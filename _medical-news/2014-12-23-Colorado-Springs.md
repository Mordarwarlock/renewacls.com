A woman, who had apparently overdosed, was unresponsive when a police officer arrived at the victim’s home. The police was the first to respond and found the 50-year old without a pulse and was turning blue. He immediately leapt into action and performed CPR and chest compressions while the victim’s husband also helped by resuscitating her. Just as paramedics arrived at the scene, the woman had regained consciousness and restored a pulse. She was taken to a hospital after that. The officer’s actions were being greatly commended because if not for him, the victim would not be in a stable condition.
