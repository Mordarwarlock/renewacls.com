A mother screamed for help after finding her 3-year old son at the bottom of a 6-feet deep pool in an Oakland Park apartment. Luckily, a maintenance worker was near and he helped her pulled the kid out of the pool. He immediately administered CPR to the child and prayed hard while pumping. Another bystander, a woman who was visiting a friend in the complex, ran to the area upon hearing the mother’s yells. She helped the maintenance worker and together they did CPR on the little boy. The two performed CPR until rescue arrived but it wasn’t until the patient got to the hospital did he become stable.
