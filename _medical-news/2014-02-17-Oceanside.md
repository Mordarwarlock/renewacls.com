Melissa and Paul Pestana thought they would lose their baby after delivering Zavier at home, because they could not get him to breathe. After calling 911, firefighters rushed into the scene and ushered the family inside the ambulance. During their ride, the firefighters performed CPR on the newly- delivered infant. They successfully removed the amniotic sac, but the first independent breath of the infant happened when he was cut free from his umbilical cord. The parents were thankful for the firefightersâ€™ attempts, which secured the safety of the child. After two months, the family and their bouncing baby boy paid a visit to their heroes.
