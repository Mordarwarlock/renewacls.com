You hear a lot of negative things about high school students but one Claysville teen proved them to be wrong. A senior high school student was working in Minteerâ€™s Market on Main Street when someone went inside and called for help after a man went into cardiac arrest outside the market. The student is a member of the Boy Scouts for 11 years where he learned how to do CPR. He knew what he needed to do and so he performed CPR on the victim until emergency responders arrived and took over. The victim was revived. As for the 18-year old student, everything that he learned from his Boy Scouts training paid off during that day.
