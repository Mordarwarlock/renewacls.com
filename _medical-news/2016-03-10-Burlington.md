Barry Martin was swimming at the river with his friends when he noticed a teenager in trouble.  Cain Smith had jumped from the covered bridge into the water, but instead of swimming, began sinking to the bottom.  Martin dove down into the river to find Smith and brought him to the shore where he began performing CPR.  Smith had made a bad jump, landing on his chest and then stopped breathing.  It's likely that Martin saved Smith's life which is something Smith's family is very grateful for.
