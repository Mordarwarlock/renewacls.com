A 49-year old man was unresponsive with his wife trying to wake him when police arrived at the parking lot of Fuddruckers in Roxbury Mall restaurant. When they determined the victim had no pulse, they got him out of the car and lay him on the ground where they performed CPR. One officer administered the CPR, the other assisting him while the third prepared the AED. They applied one shock and resumed CPR. Shortly after that, the victimâ€™s pulse was restored and he was able to breathe on his own again. He was taken to a hospital where he recovered.
