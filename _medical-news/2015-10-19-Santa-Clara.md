Santa Cruz fire Battalion Chief Mike Ditano tells the Santa Cruz Sentinel the driver went over an 8-inch parking block then tore through a 4-foot rail and plunged about 20 feet into the ocean Saturday night.
Eyewitnesses tell the Santa Cruz Sentinel the white Cadillac swerved to avoid a pickup truck leaving the area.
Lifeguards in swim fins and wetsuits swam to the white sedan and brought a man to the surface and swam him to the beach on a paddle board.
