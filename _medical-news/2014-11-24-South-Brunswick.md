Most of us wouldn’t know what to do during an emergency situation. We would have frozen on the spot, our minds momentarily shut off before leaping into action in a panic haze. A CPR-trained teacher not only knows how to perform CPR, she also showed an admirable presence of mind when her 61-year old husband had a heart attack. After calling 911, leaving their porch light on, and opening their front door for when help arrives, she began CPR. Officers arrived with a portable defibrillator and used it on the victim. The AED and CPR worked and the victim was suddenly alert and conscious. He now calls his wife a hero.
