A 65-year old man was lucky to survive an apparent heart attack, or maybe he was lucky that there were people who contributed to help him during that moment. When EMTs arrived at the scene, they found that there were already a handful of people providing aid to the victim, including police officers and a bystander. It was the bystander who first began applying chest compressions on the victim. That action proved to be an important factor in saving the man’s life. EMTs used a defibrillator to administer shock to the victim. They continued providing CPR inside the ambulance and that was when the victim came around.
