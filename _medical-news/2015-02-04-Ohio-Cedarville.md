It’s very important to pay attention during class because you’ll never know if you might have to save someone’s life. A pharmacy student at Cedarville University was able to apply what he learned during his CPR class when his neighbor knocked on his door, asking for help. The neighbor’s baby had a seizure and did not have a pulse when brought to the student. He immediately performed CPR on the 2-year old, with only the knowledge of what he learned during his training. As it turned out, this was enough to revive the little boy before EMT arrived and for the parents to regard him as a hero.
