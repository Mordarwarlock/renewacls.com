A woman was acting “unusually”, according to a group of fishermen at an Atlantic City inlet. She was walking to the rocks with a baby, who turned out to be her 1-month old daughter, when all of a sudden she threw the infant into the water and then jumped in as well. Two fishermen immediately jumped into the water and rescued the mother and daughter. The infant turned out to be unresponsive and a retired firefighter who happened to be on the jetty administered CPR to the baby and was able to revive her. He did two breaths, patted the infant on the back and she spitted out a lot of water.
