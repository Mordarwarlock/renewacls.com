A student at a California high school suddenly collapsed while participating in conditioning drills in his chosen sport. The coaches and a parent who saw him fall to the ground during his cardio exercise immediately went to his aid and took turns performing CPR. They also dialed 911 and waited for the paramedics to arrive and take over. Upon arriving, the emergency management team restarted his heart on-site and sent him to the hospital, where he is housed in the intensive care unit. The studentâ€™s mother thanked those who helped and gave prayers for her son and is hopeful that his condition would improve
