Dave Clark, a news photographer, was preparing for his work for the 6pm local news when he suddenly saw a man unconscious in his car. He assessed the situation, and upon realizing the need for immediate help, immediately pulled the man out of the car and he performed CPR. The news reporter who was also on the scene was quick to dial 911. Dave applied chest compressions to the man when he noticed that his heart rate was getting slower. He was revived and was immediately brought to the nearest hospital for further evaluation and care. Dave became a bona fide lifesaver on a normal day at work.
