A boy and his father discovered a woman who was unconscious in a pond. She wasn’t breathing. The boy just had CPR training in his school while the father had experience as a veteran firefighter. Together, they worked to save the woman’s life. The boy performed chest compressions while the father administered rescue breaths. Inspired by their efforts, the Harrison College in Indianapolis will honor these two heroes on August 15. The campus will also offer free CPR training classes as part of the celebration. The father and son is happy to be able to save a life and inspire people.
