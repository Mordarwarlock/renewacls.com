Early Christmas morning, a horrible incident took place in a mobile home. The house was on fire and two people were trapped inside. Firefighters were able to save the first man who was semi-conscious but the second victim needed more help. When the second victim was brought outside, he was not breathing. The firefighters immediately began CPR and for five minutes, gave compressions to the victim. By the time an ambulance arrived, the rescuers had already felt a pulse. The two victims were brought to the same hospital. They received the best Christmas gift that day â€“ a second chance at life.
