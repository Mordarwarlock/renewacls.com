A boy was swimming at a Northville apartment complex when he began to drown.  His father yelled for help and Ryan Kilgore, a 21 year old Physical Therapy student, heard him from the gym where he was working out.  Kilgore quickly ran over and began performing CPR he had learned a few months before.  The boy recovered after a brief hospital stay.
