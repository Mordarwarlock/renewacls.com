The victim is a 47-year old that works as a crew member on a dredging vessel. He went into cardiac arrest aboard the ship. The crew immediately began CPR and FDNY dispatched medical personnel on board the vessel. Together with the Coast Guard and NYPD Harbor, FDNY Marine units responded to the alert for help. A bucket was brought down to the victim by an NYPD rescue helicopter. Chest compressions were continued the entire time as the victim was being airlifted and inside the helicopter. He was brought to Staten Island University South with a pulse although he was listed in critical condition.
