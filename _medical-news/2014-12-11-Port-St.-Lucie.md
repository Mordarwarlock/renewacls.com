A Treasure Coast college student was ordering lunch at a restaurant when a car lost control and went into the lake just across the street. The student did not hesitate to run to the car and there he saw the 92-year old man on the driver seat. The victim was unconscious while water was starting to enter the car. The student used a hammer to get the old man out and swam him to shore. The heroic act of the student did not end there. He began CPR when he realized that the victim was not breathing. He was able to revive the old man who was brought to a hospital for further help.
