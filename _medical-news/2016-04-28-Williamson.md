Mother Dana Welch learned CPR at the hospital shortly after her fourth child was born prematurely.  A few weeks after her birth, Piper's eyes glazed over and she struggled to breath.  Welch performed CPR on the baby and she responded.  A few minutes later, Piper had more trouble.  Welch performed 6 more rounds of CPR until paramedics arrived.  The baby was suffering from a respiratory infection to which premature babies are particularly vulnerable.  Piper is now at home and doing well.
