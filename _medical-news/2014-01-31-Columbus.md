Commander Gary Dunlap did not expect that his jokes will fail miserably when he went into cardiac arrest unexpectedly. His colleagues performed CPR on him and started with chest compressions. They also did mouth- to- mouth resuscitation to supply oxygen to their fallen friend. While the others were busy trying to revive Dunlap, Commander Michael Springer grabbed a defibrillator nearby and used it on the victim. Paramedics were notified and arrived just in time to rush Dunlap into the hospital for proper care. The victim had no recollection about what happened, but he was eternally grateful to his classmates at the police academy.
