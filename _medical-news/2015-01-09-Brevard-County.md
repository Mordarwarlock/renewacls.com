Beachgoers found an unconscious man in the surf in Brevard County and pulled him out of the water. According to them, it looked like the man, who was believed to be about 60, hit his head and there were traces of blood on his face. They started CPR and medics from Patrick Air Force Base, which is just right across the street, continued the resuscitation and eventually able to revive the man’s pulse and breathing. The medics didn’t give up on the victim and just worked on him until he was revived. Fortunately, the victim was stabilized even before going to a hospital.
