To be able to cheat death once is already a miracle but to cheat it twice is somewhat extraordinary. For a 31-year old man, that was exactly what happened. After suffering cardiac arrest at work, the victim stopped breathing and was turning blue. A co-worker pulled him out of the truck and performed CPR and was able to revive him until paramedics came. However, at some point in the ambulance, the victim died again, but luckily, he was revived once again. Three weeks later, the patient, an avid bowler, returned to the lanes, fully recovered. The victim’s fiancée said that she’s never prayed as hard during that moment.
