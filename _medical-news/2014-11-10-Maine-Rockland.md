A man was beaten by his stepson and a companion after engaging in a physical fight. The victim was beaten with a baseball bat on the head and torso and then kicked by the two suspects while he was lying on the ground. Prior to the scuffle, deputies were called to oversee the victimâ€™s stepson being at the house to get some clothing. When they arrived, they found the victim unconscious and not breathing. The man was revived by CPR performed by a deputy and he was taken to a hospital. The suspects were arrested and charged with aggravated assault.
