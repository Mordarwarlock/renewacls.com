Madi Giese was focused on working on her desk job during a tennis tournament when she witnessed a participant collapse in the court. The mother of the participant came running down the stands and screamed for anyone who knows CPR. Giese was shocked since nobody in the crowd moved, while others are just calling 911. With training from the Junior Lifeguard program, she volunteered to do CPR to the unconscious victim. After a few chest compressions, the girl coughed and struggled to regain her breathing. The mother is clearly traumatized, so she didn’t leave her daughter’s side all the way to the hospital. Praises for Giese were plentiful, but her only wish is that students would take the time to learn the valuable medical technique that is CPR.
