A woman who happened by her choice garden store suddenly heard a man cry for help. She rushed towards the sound of the desperate pleas and found a woman, unconscious on the ground. The man, her husband, was trying to wake her up. She hurried to assess the situation, and upon finding out that the woman was experiencing cardiac arrest, asked the man if she could perform CPR on his wife. The man fearfully agrees. The woman performed chest compressions to help stimulate the heart’s reactivation. After a while, she was revived and brought to the nearest emergency care institution.
