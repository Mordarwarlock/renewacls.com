What seemed to be a typical working day for a man had turned into a nightmare. As he was trimming a tree, he accidentally hit a power line and went into cardiac arrest. The next thing he remembers is waking up to a hospital. The victim wasn’t breathing and has no pulse when fire-rescue arrived. They performed CPR for ten minutes and shocked his heart three times before getting a pulse back. The actions practically brought the man back to life. Luckily, the fire-rescue team was in the area when they received the call – a few minutes too late and who knows what would have happened.
