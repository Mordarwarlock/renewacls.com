A woman attending the Mountain Festival in Bluefield suddenly experienced cardiac arrest. Rescue personnel were called upon and manual CPR was performed. When the EMS came to the womanâ€™s aid, they brought with them a revolutionary machine that would perform CPR while the team would transport the patient carefully to the hospital: the Lucas CPR. The machine delivered precise CPR to the woman. Through that, manpower was greatly utilized. The woman was revived and she reached the hospital in time. Her long-term care was immediate and exact, and the Bluefield Rescue Squad has the Lucas CPR machine to thank for that.
