A boy of 5 years was seen swimming in a community pool one day when suddenly he sank to the bottom. Bystanders fished him out of the water and immediately performed CPR on him. As they were waiting for the emergency responders to arrive, they performed chest compressions to the boy. After a while, local firefighters and the EMS arrived at the scene to continue the revival. The boy was eventually revived and was taken via ambulance to the nearest hospital for immediate care. Once stabilized, he was ferried by a helicopter to the Childrenâ€™s Medical Center in Dallas, Texas for advanced medical intervention.
