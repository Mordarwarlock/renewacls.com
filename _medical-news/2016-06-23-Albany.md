Chelsea Noe, paramedic, was driving to an appointment when she noticed State Trooper Ian Henry pulling an unconscious man out of his car.  The two performed CPR on Robert Guynup and also made use of a defibrilator.  First responders then arrived on scene to transport Guynup to the hospital.  Noe says she was happy to be able to help and give Guynup a second chance at life.
