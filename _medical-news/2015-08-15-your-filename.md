During a sunny day at the beach, an off-duty firefighter became concerned about a man who was swimming farther and farther away. Being an experienced diver, Christ Flaherty decided to follow Sean Malone, who is the 54-year-old brother of the Deputy Fire Chief of the Boston Fire Department. However, when he reached the spot where Malone is last seen, he couldnâ€™t see anyone. Luckily, a powerboat driven by teens came out of nowhere and got Flaherty aboard. Together, they searched for Malone and found him unconscious and floating. Once they hauled the elderly on board, the firefighter and two teens applied CPR while the 3rd teen drove the boat to the shore. Paramedics arrived on time to transport Malone to the hospital where he is expected to make a full recovery. Thanks to the firefighter and teens, the chest compressions gave Malone a fighting chance to live.
