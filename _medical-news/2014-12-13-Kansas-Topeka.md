A recreation division supervisor for Shawnee County Parks and Recreation was honored for a very important role she played in helping revive a man who had a massive heart attack during a basketball game. If not for the quick actions of the people who helped, a man wouldn’t have lived to tell the tale. The victim, a retired firefighter, collapsed on the court after suffering a heart attack. An employee and two nurses performed CPR on the victim and when that did not help, the supervisor ran to get the AED. With the use of the device, the nurses were able to restore the victim’s pulse.
