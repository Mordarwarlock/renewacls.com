Elinor Courson was out to dinner with her parents when her mother noticed an older man at a nearby table was experiencing a medical emergency. Her mother approached the man and spoke to him, but when he collapsed, she told her husband to call 911. Elinor was hoping for someone with more qualifications to respond, but when no one did, began performing CPR. The 17 year old had learned CPR at summer camp 2 years before. The man recovered from the event.
