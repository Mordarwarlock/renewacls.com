A boy was leisurely eating grapes when one lodged in his airway, preventing him from breathing. He was choking and he was desperate for help. His sister was close by, and she ran to him to assess his situation. Using her knowledge of CPR and other life-saving maneuvers that she learned in school, she quickly went behind her brother to perform the Heimlich maneuver. He was flailing and was expressing a distinct panic because of his predicament, but his sister was well-rounded and was able to pull out the fruit from his throat. Learning about CPR and basic life support will enable students to act calmly in such situations.
