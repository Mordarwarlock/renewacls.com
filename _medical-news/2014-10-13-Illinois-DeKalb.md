In any other given day, an NIU employee wouldn’t have been present on the day her co-worker collapsed at work. The two females just had lunch together and around 10 minutes after returning to the office, the victim collapsed on the floor. Her colleague started shaking her but she was not breathing at that point and her heart not beating. Luckily, her rescuer knew how to do CPR and so she immediately began applying chest compressions. As it turned out, that quick action saved the victim from possible neurological damage and she was one of the very few who were able to survive sudden heart failure like that, all thanks to a co-worker who covered someone’s shift that day.
