A 911 dispatcher in Galax broke the rules when he received a call from a frantic mother explaining that her baby is not breathing. Rescue wonâ€™t come for another 20 minutes and so the dispatcher had to make a big decision at that moment. He decided to give CPR instructions to the caller over the phone. He was not allowed to do this because the Galax Police Department was still in the process of obtaining an emergency medical dispatch certification. The dispatcher may have broken the rules but because of it, the baby was revived by his mother, who did not know how to administer CPR if not for the instructions of the dispatcher.
