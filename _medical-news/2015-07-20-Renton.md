A house was on fire. Thankfully the people that were inside were able to get out safely. They were an elderly man, an elderly woman and their son who was an adult. They were talking when the woman suddenly collapsed. She fell to the ground, unconscious. A 15-year-old boy, who had CPR training in their school, immediately went to her aid. He performed CPR until the arrival of the emergency responders. She was taken to the hospital for further care. The family was thankful for the boyâ€™s bravery and quick thinking. He was able to save a life because of his training in school.
