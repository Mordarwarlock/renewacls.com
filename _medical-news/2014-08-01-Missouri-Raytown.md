Mother and son were off to do some errands. They went to take the son’s driving test but that didn’t happen as the mother collapsed in the middle of a conversation with a Driver Examination Office employee. The victim has heart problems, according to her son. Luckily for everyone, the employees of DEO just recently renewed their CPR training. Two employees quickly performed CPR on the victim after failing to feel pulse. The victim started to breathe and regained consciousness and was taken to a hospital by an ambulance. The victim’s family couldn’t have been more grateful to the fact that the employees were re-certified in CPR just the week before the incident.
