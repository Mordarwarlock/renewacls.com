Jeff Horton was chatting with a customer in his shop one day when he suddenly saw the man slump to the ground, unconscious. Jeff immediately went towards the man and he assessed the situation. Learning that his heart had stopped, he immediately performed chest compressions on him. He told someone to call the emergency hotline and he guided his nephew in performing CPR, as well. Jeff was incidentally an EMT for their fire department, so he immediately knew what to do. The customer was revived and was very thankful that Jeff was there to help him in his time of great need.
