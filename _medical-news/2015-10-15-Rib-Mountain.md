A man in his early twenties was found by two gentlemen fighting for his own life at the bottom of a pool at Rib Mountain. Nelson Bob and Jason Bob were on a tour of Central Wisconsin, having come from Chippewa Falls. The two successfully pulled the young man from the pool, and immediately began to perform CPR on him. A short moment later he managed to breath on his own, before being rushed to Wausau Aspirus hospital for further medical attention.
