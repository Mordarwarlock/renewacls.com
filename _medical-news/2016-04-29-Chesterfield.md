On November 20, Melissa and Mackenzie Zimmerman were at home when they heard a loud noise.  Their father had fallen down due to heart failure.  The sisters called their mother who is a nurse.  Then, they called 911 and started CPR with the help of the dispatcher.  They had learned CPR at school and remembered what to do with the help of the dispatcher.  Soon, medical teams arrived and took Mr. Zimmerman to the hospital.  He is now recovering at home.
