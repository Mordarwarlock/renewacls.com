On-duty lifeguards save lives by job description, but not all the time are they awarded for such courage, quick thinking and teamwork. Kandice Harlan and Juston Marcos were working at the Frisco Athletic Center when they heard the news about a drowning bout at the outdoor pool. Carefully hauling the child towards the pool deck, the two applied chest compressions while other employees called 911 and implemented the center’s emergency plan. Thanks to their dedicated CPR efforts, the paramedics did not have trouble reviving him. The 3-year-old boy was rushed to the hospital where he recovered fully from the incident. The Frisco Parks and Recreation board honored the two head lifeguards in an official ceremony.
