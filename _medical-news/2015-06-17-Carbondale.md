Sammy Tubbs was in his room in a Good Samaritan House, just preparing for his temporary job one morning when he heard someone yell the need for emergency services. He went outside to find out what the fuss was all about. He saw an acquaintance lying unconscious on the ground. After assessing his situation, Sammy immediately performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him until the arrival of the emergency management team. He had previous knowledge of CPR as a volunteer fireman in the ‘80s. Such a knowledge ultimately saved the man’s life. Sammy says that he’s no hero, but to the man he just saved, he definitely is.
