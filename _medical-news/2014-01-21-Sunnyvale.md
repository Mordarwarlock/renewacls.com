Lindsay Dolan received CPR training from a high school program, but she did not think it was important until her mother needed it. While watching a 49ers game, her mother, Lori, went into cardiac arrest. Together with their neighbor, Joey Gonzales, Lindsay performed CPR compressions on her mother so her brain would not lack oxygen. The other family members called for help. Luckily, Lori made a full recovery in the hospital, where she was brought in after the incident. Doctors were impressed about the heroic actions of the teens, and commended the Fremort High School for requiring a CPR class for all freshmen.
