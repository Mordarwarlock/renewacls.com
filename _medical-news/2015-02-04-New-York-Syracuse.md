Several people were at the right place at the right time when an 87-year old man had a heart attack and collapsed while shoveling. A mail carrier was flagged down by a woman and he immediately saw the man lying in the driveway. He did not know how to do CPR but he did chest compressions on the elderly man. He spotted a neighbor and asked him if he knows CPR. Luckily, the neighbor did know how to do CPR and another neighbor helped by resuscitating the victim. Due to everyone’s effort, along with the rescue squad, the elderly man is now recovering at a hospital.
