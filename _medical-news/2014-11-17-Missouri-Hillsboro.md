A senior high school student who was inside Walmartâ€™s dressing room quickly went out when she heard someone calling for help at the store. Apparently, an 11-month old stopped breathing and the mother was trying to revive the baby. The teen, who was aisles away from the scene, immediately jumped in to help the baby. She had recently learned how to do CPR in one of her classes and was able to apply what she learned during that tense moment. With the mother and other shoppers looking on, the teen did what she needed to do and she was able to restore the breathing of the infant.
