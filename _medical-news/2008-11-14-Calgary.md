During basketball practice, Curtis Rosenau suffered from a catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular fibrillation. He stopped breathing and collapsed in court, which was witnessed by his basketball coach, who happens to be his father. Frantic, his father administered CPR on him and even tried using an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) with the help of a lifeguard who was also nearby. Medical help got delayed, but Curtis was still not breathing when they came to the rescue. A total of 13 shocks and intense CPR were needed to get a pulse and bring the basketball player back to life. However, the ordeal was not yet through. Doctors used cooling blankets to stabilize Curtisâ€™ temperature. His diagnosis urged his brother and father to check their respective conditions, and surprisingly, they also suffer the same illness.
