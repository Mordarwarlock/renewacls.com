Valentine’s Day is usually filled with love, but Aly DeMarco ditched possible dates to save her dad. The 42- year- old Michael suffered a cardiac arrest after experiencing a serious bout of chest pains. Upon losing consciousness, her daughter acted on instinct and called 911 immediately. The operator was able to alert a nearby hospital while giving Aly CPR instructions to increase her dad’s fighting chance. The counting of compressions seems like forever to Aly, but the emergency responders did not take long to reach their home. They were able to revive Michael with a portable defibrillator before sending him to the emergency room. Aly is the reason her dad is alive and the family will never forget that.
