NYPD officers Salomon Daphina and Mildred Rodriguez responded to a call regarding a 2 year old who was suffocating on her home's floor.  The child suffers from a genetic condition that affects bone and tissue of the face, and can at times affect a young child's airways.  The officers began chest compressions immediately until an ambulance arrived.  After being carried to the ambulance, the girl was able to begin breathing again.  She was transferred to the children's hospital where the officers later arrived to visit her.
