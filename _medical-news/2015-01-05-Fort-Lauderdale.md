An Italian family’s vacation has quickly turned into a nightmare when one of the children, a 4-year old boy drowned in the pool of a cruise ship. The Royal Caribbean ship does not have a lifeguard at its pool, just like in any hotel. The victim was believed to be “swept under’ the water and when he was pulled out, he no longer had a pulse. CPR was performed immediately by the ship’s infirmary. They also had to use “aggressive advanced life support” before they were able to revive the boy. However, the victim still remains to be in critical condition.
