title: BLS Courses & Classes
---


EMT Concepts will soon offer Basic Life Support certification as well as recertification online. These courses can conveniently be done 100% online. This online access allows medical professionals and practitioners the opportunity to get their PALS provider card without having to find a local class that works into their busy schedule. This certification is also achieved without having to do a hands-on skills test.  

We created these courses with the busy healthcare professionals in mind who would not be able to take the course due to limits of their daily schedules. Our courses can be taken at your own pace as there are no time limits enforced.  

Once you purchase the online BLS course, you will receive instant access to our study guides for the course you selected (certification or recertification), so you can study the material specific to the exam. When you are ready to take the exam, it will need to be completed successfully in one session for the provider card.  

Unlike many other sites, we include 3 free retakes on all our BLS classes as our goal is for you to achieve cert or recert. Should you not pass on your first try, our system list out the answers you missed so you can easily lock in on areas to study.

**Note:** As we continue to work through our BLS online course offering, we will provide recommendations to top providers until we are able to bring our course offering live. In the meantime we suggest.
